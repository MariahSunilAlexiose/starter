It is a web development project template with custom made components using TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. You're also focusing on maintaining a consistent code style and ensuring code quality with tools like ESLint and Prettier. Plus, I have used Husky and lint-staged for running checks before commits.

@types/node: Type definitions for Node.js, helpful if you're working with Node.js in a TypeScript project.

@types/react: Type definitions for React, useful for ensuring type safety in a React project.

@types/react-dom: Type definitions for React DOM, providing types for React DOM methods and properties.

eslint: A tool to find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.

eslint-config-next: ESLint configuration for Next.js projects.

eslint-config-prettier: An ESLint configuration to disable rules that conflict with Prettier.

husky: A tool to configure Git hooks, useful for enforcing certain rules before commits.

## Getting Started
First, download the exisiting dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
